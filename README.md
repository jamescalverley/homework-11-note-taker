## Project Title
Homework-11-Note Taker 

## Project Description
This project involved creating HTML routes to utilize GET, POST and DELETE requests in order to display, create and delete the notes. Each note object contained a unique ID, note title and note text, which was saved to a JSON file. 

## Next Steps
An improvement for this project would be to create user accounts so a user could sign in with an email address and password to access their own personal notes.
